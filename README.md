** this module had starter code ** 

1. used moment.js to display the current date at the top of the page 
2. created a function that was going to loop through the id's and convert it to a number value so that it can be compared to the current hour variable
3. depending on the time, the description box should display either a grey, red or green color
4. I created a click function that will save the data entered into description into localStorage


** I keep having issues with my relative path. my css will only work when I provide the full path**
